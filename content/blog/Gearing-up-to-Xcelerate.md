In the seven months since the last blog post we have been [coding](https://industryconnect.io/Authority/ViewCertificate?guid=d0640a6f-a54a-45a7-bdd2-a1dacebed1e9) in rust, [listening](https://www.crowdcast.io/e/polkadot-conversations-session4/register) to passionate community leaders, [writing](https://github.com/Greenetwork/BLX_whitepaper/raw/main/BasinLogix_whitepaper.pdf) our ideas and most importantly applying those insights and knowledge towards the development of our [natural resource management platform](platform.basinlogix.com).

There is some particularly bad weather these days, climate change is already affecting the planet in major ways and it shows no signs of letting up. The gear we've used to combat previous crises just isn't going to cut it. There is a saying among avid hikers and climbers, "There's no such thing as bad weather, just bad gear." Although we are not preparing for a mountaineering adventure, the concept still translates. 


Over the next 6 months Basin Logix will be building our vision for a natural resource management platform with the help of the UC Berkeley Blockchain Xcelerator. As part of the 2021 cohort, the Xcelerator is going to gear us up so that we can reach loftier goals at a faster pace than we otherwise could have on our own. We are very excited to have support from UC Berkeley to apply tomorrow's web 3.0 solutions to today's water resources problems.
