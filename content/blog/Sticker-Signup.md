## Sticker Signup is the fastest and easiest way to get started managing your groundwater assets.

Continuing with our grower first mentality we will be exclusively launching Sticker Signup at the [2022 California Farm Bureau Annual Meeting](https://www.cfbf.com/ag-events/annual-meeting/) in Monterey, CA.

The signup process is so fast and easy, the hardest part will be getting a hold of a sticker! Stay tuned for more sticker drop location as we will be announcing these over the coming months. Follow us on Twitter [@BasinLogix](https://twitter.com/BasinLogix) for the locations!
