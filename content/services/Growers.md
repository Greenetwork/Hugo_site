We reinvented water assets so that you can control your resource how you choose to.

## State Wide Trust
Know where you stand, no matter where you are. Basin Logix operates on a single distributed ledger, so everyone is working with the same numbers. We know your groundwater worries span the whole state, so we built a platform that does the same. 

## Quick Glance
We get data and you get information. Quick Glance lets you track your surface water and groundwater without needing to keep tabs on all the details yourself. If you want to go deeper, the data is there.

## Unlock your Water
Plan for tomorrow with water as an asset instead of a liability. Use your groundwater like you use any other input. Lease it, bank it, or use it, whatever fits your goals. Water assets on the Basin Logix platform can be leveraged without pumping a single gallon.

## Private but Compliant
Keep what's yours to yourself. Account management enables easy compliance with GSAs and water districts without having to divulge all of your activity. Only when an issue arises is detailed data shared with regulators.

## Know the Price
See the price of water, no more guessing. Basin Logix's unique groundwater auction market gets to the price per acre foot quickly so you can make decisions at the right time.
