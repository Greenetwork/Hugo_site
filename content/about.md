Basin Logix is the only platform bringing distributed technology to water management. The team has dedicated themselves to finding and delivering the best solutions to water management problems in California.

### 2017 - Understanding the water problems that exist in the Western US.
As a part of the [Penn Center for Innovation](https://pci.upenn.edu/icorps/) I-CORPs program we sought to gain insight into the viability of water markets and digitized water as a solution by speaking with water managers, consultants, entrepreneurs, state government, tribal government, federal government representatives. Checkout what we learned from our conversations.

### 2020 - Testing the feasibility of tokenizing water.

â€‹After conducting an extensive evaluation of existing models for the implementation and operation of water markets around the world, we aim at establishing a fair system of water allocations by using digital assets.

### 2021 - Beta platform launched.

With help from the [2021 UC Berkeley Blockchain Xcelerator](https://medium.com/berkeley-blockchain-xcelerator/berkeley-blockchain-xcelerator-announces-selection-of-the-2021-cohort-cdf02cdb7354) community we launched our public beta platform in October of 2021. The public beta platform is the realization of our technical and system design concepts as outlined in our whitepaper.

### 2022 - Examined the role of trust in common pool resources. 
Explored different frameworks for understanding common pool resource problems with the Ostrom Institute's [Summer Seminar](https://ostromworkshop.indiana.edu/courses-teaching/summer-academy/index.html).
