 &amp;ldquo;Such resources [&amp;hellip;natural resourcesâ€¦] share with most of the capital of society the property of being exhaustible, and if we want to maintain or increase our income, we must be able to replace each resource that is being used up with a new one that will make at least an equal contribution to future income.&amp;rdquo; [1]
 The mindset of necessary consumption of natural resources resulting in economic growth has been and continues to be in the subconscious of enterprising Americans.</description>

Cubes, Cryptography and Common Pool Resources Two weeks ago Basin Logix was at the Association of California Water Agencies (ACWA) 2022 Spring conference in the imposing Sacramento conference center. This was our first time at ACWA and lucky for us we secured a booth right in front of the exhibitor hall entrance. Around us were the standard fare of conference exhibitor swag up for grabs: bowls of candy, business card raffles to win gadgets, company stationary, and even the crowd-pleasing mini putting green.</description>

      <description>April 5th, 2022
When we seek to understand water on earth there are two types of variables, units of time and units of water. Combining the units helps us quantify water: Gallons per minute, acre-feet per year, cubic-feet per second, inches per hour, etc.
Time is the constant by which everything is relativized. Combining time and water on paper helps us quantify the resource, but combining time and water on earth yields life.</description>

In the seven months since the last blog post we have been coding in rust, listening to passionate community leaders, writing our ideas and most importantly applying those insights and knowledge towards the development of our natural resource management platform.
There is some particularly bad weather these days, climate change is already affecting the planet in major ways and it shows no signs of letting up. The gear we&amp;rsquo;ve used to combat previous crises just isn&amp;rsquo;t going to cut it.</description>

A few weeks ago I was invited to speak at Substrate Seminar, a weekly meeting where people share what they are working on in the realm of Substrate, a platform for producing unique blockchains. A one hour conversation about some of my learnings as a beginner, turned out to actually be a step towards realizing Basin Logix&amp;rsquo;s long term project goals.
My interest in building with Substrate began in earnest a few months ago, when I completed a blockchain developer course in Ethereum.</description>
